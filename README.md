> ### ___Application Architecture___
<p> For The Greene app we chose to design it in accordance with <strong>...</strong> pattern because it seemed to be the most suitable for our team. Since our team consists of four developers ... allowed us distribute responsibilities and work independently within our own scope.... also let us divide the application in multiple development sectors and envision what the final result should be.<br>

Please refer to the following resources in this repository<br>
[Models](./models/) --- [Views](./views/) --- [Controllers](./controller/) <br>
[Front-end](./public/) --- [Database](./db/) --- [Seeds](./seeds/)
<br></br>

> ### ___Functionality___
<p> In this section we will briefly go over the functionality of the app and the development process</p>

- <strong> to sign up </strong>, you will need to fill out the form with the following information: first name, last name, username, email, password. <br>
After that, front end Javascript will capture this data and perform a fetch() request with a POST method to /api/users endpoint. Once the information about a new user is added to the database - a new session will be saved with user id and username to let the user freely navigate on a website.<br>

- <strong> to login </strong>, you will need to fill out the login form with your: username, email and password.
